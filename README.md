# Customer Managment Page w/ Python
 A basic GUI with CRUD functions that is created using python, SQlite, and the pyqt5 framewrok. It is an incomplete project that is supposed to be an employe management system.

 The execution file is called <LoginPage.exe> and the following files are the python files that were used to create the GUI:

 1.) AppMenu.py
 2.) BetaDeletePage.py
 3.) Create Employee.py
 4.) LoginPage.py
 5.) RegistrationPage.py
 6.) SearchCustomer.py
 7.) ShowCustomer.py

The file named <appDB.db> is the database file used in the project. The databse system was SQlite.

NOTE *** It seems you need to take out the appDb.db and customerDB.db outside the Finalproject.exe and place it in the environment just outisde the said folder and within
the same environment as .vscode 

if the databases are already outside, then you don't need to do anything else.
